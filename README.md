# Music-Genre-classification-CPRE-550-
A course project to use CNN and KNN to classify music into respective genre using GTZAN and FMA datasets


Preproccesing is done by the preprocessor scripts for CNN and then is givn as input to CNN for music genre detection. CNN is being trained on 
GTZAN and major part of FMA dataset. On the other hand KNN algorithm is trained on GTZAN alone and the feature extraction is being done to extract features MFCC , chroma, spectral contrast and normalization is being done and finally being fed to KNN and finally based on the voting the classification is being done.
